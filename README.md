#### HistoricAges

Hello All,

I would just like to say before I begin talking about this mod, the original idea came from ElConquistador, who was working on a mod named AgeCraft which has since stopped development.

#### Info
I am working on a mod named HistoricAges, this mod will be a mod based on different era's in history. You will start in the first era, technology is non present and you only have basic tools to survive. You will slowly progress and so will the world around you. You will move onto the next age after gathering the information and skills of that era, by then you should have a supply to keep yourself and your tribe(future information on this). You can progress to the next age where new things will become available, I think you get the idea.



#### Tribes
Tribes are a feature I'm still planning but here it is. When you first start out in the world you will have nothing and know no one, there will be Tribes in the world that are far ahead of you and may become your enemy, you will find other people like yourself with no home or family, you may recruit them (I am still working out how this process will work) , they may deny your offer unless you convince them otherwise, Once you have a small following you will be able to set them up on different roles and tasks, each member of your tribe has their own specialties, use these to your advantage! You will slowly build up your own village, and you may become powerful enough to over throw other Tribes. (A future feature may be that Tribes you attack may have allies who seek revenge upon your village) More to be added in the future.

#### Ages

Ages are the Era's that HistoricAges presents, each era will have it's own technology and landscape, here is the list I compiled so far.
(Note these Ages are from the AgeCraft mod which has stopped development, all credits to them!)

#### Modding Team
I am looking for a group of people experienced in each field required for this mod, they will be Textures & Graphics, Advanced Modding & Modeling.
If you don't have a very good understanding or skill for either of these then please do not apply as this wont be an easy task to create this mod, it will require dedication. If you think you're up for the task then please do not shy away from posting an application! We will be using GitHub.
